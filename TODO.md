## Sorting Algorithms:
* Bubble Sort: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
* Selection Sort: Sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element and moving it to the sorted portion.
* Insertion Sort: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
* Merge Sort: A divide and conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, sorts them, and then merges them.
* Quick Sort: Another divide and conquer algorithm that selects a pivot and partitions the array around the pivot.
* Heap Sort: A comparison-based sorting technique based on a binary heap data structure.
## Searching Algorithms:
* Linear Search: Sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found.
* Binary Search: Efficiently searches a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
## Graph Algorithms:
* Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.
* Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
* Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finds the shortest path from a source to all other vertices in a graph with non-negative weights.
* Bellman-Ford Algorithm: Computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted graph (can handle negative weights).
* Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: A dynamic programming algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but no negative cycles).
## Dynamic Programming Algorithms:
* Fibonacci Sequence: Computes Fibonacci numbers using dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations.
* Longest Common Subsequence (LCS): Finds the longest subsequence common to two sequences.
* Knapsack Problem: Solves the problem of selecting items to maximize the total value without exceeding a weight limit.
* Matrix Chain Multiplication: Finds the most efficient way to multiply a given sequence of matrices.
## Greedy Algorithms:
* Prim's Algorithm: Finds the minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph.
* Kruskal's Algorithm: Also finds the minimum spanning tree, but sorts all the edges first.
* Huffman Coding: A lossless data compression algorithm.
## String Algorithms:
* KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) Algorithm: Searches for occurrences of a word within a main text string efficiently.
* Rabin-Karp Algorithm: Searches for a pattern in a text using hashing.
## Backtracking Algorithms:
* N-Queens Problem: Places N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
* Sudoku Solver: Solves a given Sudoku puzzle.
## Miscellaneous:
* Kadane's Algorithm: Finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
* Union-Find: A data structure to keep track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint subsets.
* A Algorithm*: An informed search algorithm for finding the shortest path to a goal.
* Fast Fourier Transform (FFT): Computes the Discrete Fourier Transform and its inverse efficiently.
* Monte Carlo Algorithms: Use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle.
